## why Foo Fooss?

Do you remember the old poem/song "[Little Bunny Foo Foo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Bunny_Foo_Foo)"? Well, I was **not** the bunny rabbit who harassed a population of field mice, but I *was* the "goon".

Growing up, the nickname "Foo Foo" just stuck! However more recently, it has taken a new form as a callsign (FOOSS).

[Free and Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (FOSS) is an inclusive term and methodology for programs. It challenges prepritary software with transparency.

Since working full-time in an open-source environment, FOSS has become a true passion and principle of mine, fueling my journey in web development.

So, naturally, I combined my nickname with this acronym as a convenient callsign for myself.
