It was early morning, the day of the marathon. This was my first time ever seeing a blimp, and it looked so out of place floating above Copley Square in Boston.

It reminded me of what Ive always loved about the Truman Show: its weird ‘4th wall’ compositions.

The blimp seemed to shout at me “WAKE UP” while moving in a dream-like way behind buildings.
